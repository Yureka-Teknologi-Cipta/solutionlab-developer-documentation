# Tagging & Release

Releases mark significant milestones in our project's development lifecycle. They typically include new features, bug fixes, and improvements packaged for deployment.

## Tagging

Each release is tagged with a version number, such as v1.0.0, and may include pre-release versions like v1.0.0-beta. By tagging releases, we ensure clear documentation, facilitate deployment processes, and enable users to track project progress effectively.

### Sample

```
v1.0.0 // first release
v2.0.0 // update major release
v2.2.0 // update minor / feature
v2.2.1 // update patch
```
