# Style Guide

### Variables, Functions, and Other Identifiers
All variables, functions, and other identifiers must be named in English. This ensures consistency and readability across the codebase, making it easier for developers from different backgrounds to understand and maintain the code.

### User Interface (UI)
The language and style of the UI depend on the specific project requirements. This allows for flexibility to meet the needs of different user bases and project scopes. Ensure that the UI language and style are consistently applied throughout the project to maintain a coherent user experience.

### Comments
All comments within the code should be written in English. Clear and concise comments help explain the purpose and functionality of the code, aiding in maintenance and onboarding of new developers. Comments should be used to clarify complex logic, document assumptions, and provide context for future developers.

### File Naming
The naming of files depends on the framework being used. Adhering to the conventions of the specific framework ensures that the project remains organized and that developers can easily navigate and understand the structure. Follow the standard practices and guidelines of the chosen framework to maintain consistency.

### URLs
All URLs should be in lowercase and follow the slug-case format (e.g., example-url). This convention ensures that URLs are clean, readable, and consistent. Lowercase, slug-case URLs are also less prone to errors and are more SEO-friendly.

By following these naming conventions and style guidelines, we ensure that our codebase remains clean, consistent, and maintainable. This facilitates collaboration and helps create a robust, high-quality software product.
