# Documentation

### Postman

We use Postman as our standard platform for API documentation. Postman provides a robust, user-friendly interface for creating, managing, and sharing API documentation, ensuring consistency and clarity across our projects.

### Readme.md Requirement
Every repository should include a README.md file. This file serves as the primary documentation for the project, providing essential information that helps users and contributors understand, set up, and work with the project effectively.

Read about Readme [here](/docs/others/readme-template.md).
